INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the 2048 simulator, in this you will find my attempt to use expectimax to achieve the 16384 block 100% of the time.

No where on the internet can you find an algorithm that gets to 16384 more than 50% of the time using less than 10 look ahead steps. I'm confident as I know a crucial mistake in all their algorithms.

RUNNING THE CODE

C++ Version:
This version is used primarily for code debugging and running it fast! There are 3 modes to this game: Human, 
The game runs in this directory.
Compile by typing: make
Run by typing ./2048 {conds}
{conds} = -h  or --human            if you want to play the game yourself
{conds} = -b  or --brute            if you want to see a very simple AI
{conds} = -c  or --computer         if you want to see the best ever AI running the game!

Javascript Version:
This version is used because it is good looking. 
CSS and Javascript base came from . 
AI came from C++ source code from the C++ version but converted to Javascript using Emscripten

UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!

Have fun!!
