Welcome to the 2048 simulator, in this you will find my attempt to use expectimax to achieve the 16384 block 100% of the time.

No where on the internet can you find an algorithm that gets to 16384 more than 50% of the time using less than 10 look ahead steps. I'm confident as I know a crucial mistake in all their algorithms.
